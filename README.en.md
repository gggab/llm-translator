# LLM Translator

Translate Markdown files with popular LLM APIs and view the rendered result in a side preview pane — without leaving your editor.

## Features

- One-click translation of the Markdown file you're editing.
- Supports DeepSeek, OpenAI, Claude, GLM, Qwen, Kimi, Gemini, Doubao, MiniMax, Grok, and custom OpenAI-compatible services.
- Translate into any target language (Chinese, English, Arabic, …).
- Long documents are split into chunks automatically, preserving Markdown syntax, code blocks, links, and images.
- The preview pane follows your VS Code color theme (light / dark).
- Switch the **LLM** and **target language** directly in the preview, alongside refresh and save actions.

## Getting Started

1. Open **Settings** (`Ctrl+,` / `Cmd+,`), search for **LLM Translator**, and pick your provider in `LLM Translator: Provider`.
2. Run **LLM Translator: Set API Key** from the Command Palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P`), choose the provider, and paste the matching **API key**. The key is **stored encrypted in your OS keychain** — it is never written to `settings.json`, so it can't leak through settings sync or commits.
   - You can also just open the preview; on first run you'll be prompted for the key.
   - Run **LLM Translator: Clear API Key** to remove a stored key.
3. Set `LLM Translator: Target Language` if you don't want the default.
4. Open any `.md` file and start the preview (see below).

## Usage

With a Markdown file open, start the translation preview in any of these ways:

- Click the 🌐 icon in the editor's top-right toolbar.
- Press `Ctrl+Shift+\`.
- Run **LLM Translator: Open Translation Preview** from the Command Palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P`).

The translated, rendered Markdown opens in a pane beside your editor.

### Switch, refresh, and save

Move your mouse over the preview pane and four controls fade in at the top-right corner:

- **Model**: switch between configured providers and models, then re-translate immediately.
- **Language**: enter any target language, then re-translate immediately.
- 🔄 **Refresh**: re-translate the current file and refresh the preview (you can also run **LLM Translator: Re-translate**).
- 💾 **Save**: save the translation next to the source file, named `<source>.<targetLanguage>.<ext>` — e.g. `README.md` becomes `README.中文.md` when the target language is `中文`. If the target file already exists you're asked to confirm overwrite, and you can open it right after saving.

## Managing your API key

API keys are set and removed through the Command Palette rather than the regular Settings UI, so they never sit in plain text inside `settings.json`.

### Set an API key

1. **Open the Command Palette**: press `Ctrl` + `Shift` + `P` (`Cmd` + `Shift` + `P` on Mac). An input box appears at the top of the window.
2. **Type the command**: type `Set API Key` (typing `set api` is enough); **LLM Translator: Set API Key** shows up below — click it or press `Enter`.
3. **Pick a provider** from the list.
4. **Paste the key**: paste your API key into the input box (it's masked with dots) and press `Enter`.
5. A "saved (encrypted)" message in the bottom-right confirms it's done.

> You can also skip this: just open the preview, and on the first translation a box pops up asking for the key.

### Clear an API key

1. **Open the Command Palette**: press `Ctrl` + `Shift` + `P` (`Cmd` + `Shift` + `P` on Mac).
2. **Type the command**: type `Clear API Key` (typing `clear api` is enough); **LLM Translator: Clear API Key** shows up below — click it or press `Enter`.
3. **Pick a provider**: choose the provider whose key you want to delete.
4. A confirmation message in the bottom-right means it's removed.

> These two commands have no toolbar or right-click button — they're only available from the Command Palette (the shortcut in step 1), which is standard for VS Code extensions.
